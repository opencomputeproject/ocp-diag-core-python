# ocp-diag-python

The OCP Test & Validation Initiative is a collaboration between datacenter hyperscalers having the goal of standardizing aspects of the hardware validation/diagnosis space, along with providing necessary tooling to enable both diagnostic developers and executors to leverage these interfaces.

Specifically, the ocp-diag-python project makes it easy for developers to use the OCP Test & Validation specification artifacts by presenting a pure-python api that can be used to output spec compliant JSON messages.

To start, please see below for [installation instructions](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/ocp-diag-python#installation) and [usage](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/ocp-diag-python#usage).
